STUDY NOTES

Explain what IaC is:

Infrastructure as a Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation instead of manually performed actions,scripts can be executed to automate the creation, configuration and management of infrastructure resources. IaC treats infrastructure, including servers, networks, and other resources, as if they were software applications.

Describe advantages of IaC patterns:

1. Efficiency: quick and easy provisioning the infrastructure help to reduce time required to set up and scale resources. Automation eliminates human errors and inconsistencies.
2. Scalability: with IaC, infrastructure can be easily scaled up or down based on the demand. Code scripts can be modified to adjust resource quantities or configurations as needed.
3. Versioning and history: IaC can be stored in version control systems, enabling teams to trck changes over time. It helps to understand whi did what and why so everything is clear.
4. Reproducibility: Iac enables recreation of infrastructure environments exactly as they were at specific point in time. Useful for testing and troubleshooting.
5. Consistency: IaC ensures all environments are consistent, reducing the likelihood of mix-ups and confusion.
6. Collaboration: teams can collaborate in infrastructure development and share code, enablingmore agile and coordinated approach ro managing infrastructure.

2 Understand Terraform's purpose (vs other IaC)

Explain multi—cloud and provider—agnostic benefits,
Explain the benefits of state.
