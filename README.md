## STUDY NOTES

### Explain what IaC is:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation instead of manually performed actions. Scripts can be executed to automate the creation, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. IaC treats infrastructure, including servers, networks, and other resources, as if they were software applications.

### Describe advantages of IaC patterns:

1. Efficiency: Quick and easy provisioning of infrastructure helps reduce the time required to set up and scale resources. Automation eliminates human errors and inconsistencies.
2. Scalability: With IaC, infrastructure can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. Code scripts can be modified to adjust resource quantities or configurations as needed.
3. Versioning and history: IaC can be stored in version control systems, enabling teams to track changes over time. It helps understand who did what and why so everything is clear.
4. Reproducibility: IaC enables the recreation of infrastructure environments exactly as they were at a specific point in time. Useful for testing and troubleshooting.
5. Consistency: IaC ensures all environments are consistent, reducing the likelihood of mix-ups and confusion.
6. Collaboration: Teams can collaborate in infrastructure development and share code, enabling a more agile and coordinated approach to managing infrastructure.

### Understand Terraform's purpose (vs other IaC):

### Explain multi-cloud and provider-agnostic benefits:

Setting up infrastructure across multiple clouds improves fault-tolerance and recovery from provider outages. Yet, multi-cloud setups are complex due to differing interfaces. Terraform simplifies management by offering a consistent workflow for various providers and cross-cloud dependencies to build large-scale multi-cloud infrastructures.

### Terraform registry:

Terraform Registry is a platform that hosts various provider plugins for Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. These provider plugins allow Terraform to interact with different cloud providers, services, and technologies, enabling users to define, manage, and deploy infrastructure across various platforms using a consistent and declarative approach.
